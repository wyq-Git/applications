## Contributing New CV Applications

To contribute a new CV application:

1. Place your notebook in the corresponding model directory.
2. If the model does not yet have its own directory, create a new one following the existing structure.
3. Follow the notebook writing and naming standards in the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/mindspore-courses/applications/wiki/Contributing-Guidelines).
4. Update the application list in the README if required.

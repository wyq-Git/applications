## Contributing New Multi-Modal Applications

To contribute a new Multi-Modal application:

3. Follow the notebook writing and naming standards in the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/mindspore-courses/applications/wiki/Contributing-Guidelines).
4. Update the application list in the README if required.

# Audio Applications

This directory contains ready-to-use Audio application notebooks built with MindSpore. Each notebook demonstrates a complete or partial workflow—training, finetuning, or inference—along with a brief introduction to the model used.

## Contributing New Audio Applications

To contribute a new Audio application:

1. Place your notebook in the corresponding model directory.
2. If the model does not yet have its own directory, create a new one following the existing structure.
3. Follow the notebook writing and naming standards in the [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/mindspore-courses/applications/wiki/Contributing-Guidelines).
4. Update the application list in the README if required.
